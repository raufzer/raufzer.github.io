My career path has been defined by a passion for pushing technological boundaries and delivering impactful solutions in Machine Learning, AI, and Software Development.

As you'll discover, each role in my journey has been more than just a position—it's been an opportunity to solve complex problems and create meaningful technological advancements. From developing sophisticated financial prediction models at Marva.ai to engineering efficient ML pipelines at Knowledge Solutions India, and pioneering digital marketing strategies at Laugh Out Loud Ventures, each experience has built upon the last.

And like my continued contributions to Open Source, I'm just getting started.

The question isn't whether you need someone with my skills—it's whether you're ready for the results I deliver.
