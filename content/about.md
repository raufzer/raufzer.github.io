I have been working with ML models, data and AI  for the past 7 years of my life and I’ve got this drive to push boundaries and make things happen. I love the rush of cracking a tough problem, whether it’s coding something new or figuring out how far I can take a wild idea. Building stuff that’s smart and useful? That’s my jam.

This portfolio’s me in a nutshell—projects I’ve messed with, blogs where I ramble. I’m into creating, learning, and not settling for boring. If you’re curious, hit me up on any of my socials. Let’s see what’s next.

I'm currently available for internships and full-time opportunities. If you're looking for someone passionate, skilled, and ready to contribute, I'm here to help bring your ideas to life!
